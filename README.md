This ain't my first project, but the first one I upload to git. Hence, I'm still trying to get the hang of this.
TBH, I upload this as a homework from "RevoU: Fundamental Course."
Currently, I still learning HTML, CSS, AND JS; with JS as my weakest subject. I hope whoever read this wanna spare their time to help me improving this. ðŸ˜„
